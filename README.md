# top-battleship

This is a Battleship game built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
It follows the classic Battleship rules where two players place ships on a 10x10 board and take turns attacking each other.

The project is part of The Odin Project curriculum, focusing on JavaScript object-oriented programming, DOM manipulation, basic game logic, and Test-Driven Development (TDD) using Jest.
